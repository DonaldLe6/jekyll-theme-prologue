<p>Hi, I'm Donald and I am an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying mechanical engineering. I created this website to showcase some 
of my favorite projects that I have worked on so far. As an engineer, I really enjoy the wide range of challenges that I get to face on a daily basis and 
coming up with unique solutions to engineering problems. I love the creativity that can manifested  from the engineering process and 
most of all I enjoy learning about how things work.</p>
